## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works

The Knowledge Collaboratory consists in an OpenAPI service and a  user-friendly web UI to query the Nanopublications network, store  Nanopublication authentication keys, and publish Nanopublications.

üóÑÔ∏è **Backend API**: an OpenAPI built with Python and FastAPI, to store the keys on the server, and run the process to publish a Nanopublication.

üåê **Webapp frontend**: a website built with TypeScript, ReactJS and Astro, to provide a user-friendly access to the Nanopublication network.
