## The data

Identification of Drug-Disease Associations Using Information of Molecular Structures and Clinical Symptoms via Deep Convolutional Neural Network: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6966717

3 files:

1. 1MB gold standard (mostly curated from CTD)

> Finally, 26,521 drug-disease associations containing 4,501 drugs and 2,093 diseases were obtained ([Supporting Information 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6966717/#SM1)). These retrieved drug-disease associations were considered as positive examples.

| Chemical Name          | Chemical ID (MeSH identifier) | Chemical CAS registry number | Disease name       | Disease ID (MeSH or OMIM identifier) | Chemical ID (Pubchem CID) |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| 10-hydroxycamptothecin | C028098                       | 67656-30-8                   | Huntington Disease | MESH:D006816                         | 97226                     |
| 10-hydroxycamptothecin | C028098                       | 67656-30-8                   | Liver Neoplasms    | MESH:D008113                         | 97226                     |

2. a small independent test set (same type of columns as file 1)

> independent test set, which were generated by collecting drug-disease associations information from the CTD database (Ver. Jun, 2019). The independent test set contains 1,323 drug-disease associations ([Supporting Information 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6966717/#SM2)), which are not included in the benchmark dataset

3. the 300k predicted associations from the CNN

> We rank all the potential associations according to the probability in descending order, and the results show that 294,354 associations ([Supporting Information 3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6966717/#SM3)) are the most likely to be putative associations

| Disease name    | Chemical ID (Pubchem CID) |
| --------------- | ------------------------- |
| Alopecia Areata | 5311                      |
| Alopecia Areata | 4421                      |
| Alopecia        | 38                        |

> Resolve Disease name with the NameResolver API? 

## Check CTD?

**Should we add CTD** drug-disease associations? (I think it's in the supporting information 1)
But the chemical-disease CSV is 600M: http://ctdbase.org/downloads/ vs only 1M of final curated drug-disease associations from CTD in the publication

7.307.990 lines in the chemical-drug CSV, e.g.

```
Zymosan,D015054,9010-72-4,Wounds and Injuries,MESH:D014947,,TNF,27.97,,21192278
zymostenol,C056855,566-97-2,Chondrodysplasia Punctata,MESH:D002806,marker/mechanism,,,,18176751
```

## How it is published

Each association is published as a separate nanopublication in the Nanopublication network (http://nanopub.org/wordpress/). 

Associations are represented using the BioLink model: https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model

You will need to setup you nanopub private key to run this script (be careful it will publish a duplicate of the nanopublications)
