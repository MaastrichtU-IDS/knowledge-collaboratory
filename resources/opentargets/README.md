## The data

https://www.opentargets.org/

Open Targets is an innovative, large-scale, multi-year, public-private partnership that uses human genetics and genomics data for systematic drug target identification and prioritisation.

Visit the [Open Targets Platform](https://www.targetvalidation.org/) which integrates public domain data to enable target identification and prioritisation, or the [Open Targets Genetics Portal](https://genetics.opentargets.org/) which identifies targets based on GWAS and functional genomics. We complement data integration with large scale systematic experimental approaches to support target identification, prioritisation and validation. Check out [our latest papers](https://www.opentargets.org/publications) describing our experimental target identification approaches in oncology, neurodegeneration, and immunity and inflammation.

## How it is published

Each association is published as a separate nanopublication in the Nanopublication network (http://nanopub.org/wordpress/). 

Associations are represented using the BioLink model: https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model

You will need to setup you nanopub private key to run this script (be careful it will publish a duplicate of the nanopublications)
