## How it is published

Each association is published as a separate nanopublication in the Nanopublication network (http://nanopub.org/wordpress/). 

Associations are represented using the BioLink model: https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model

You will need to setup you nanopub private key to run this script (be careful it will publish a duplicate of the nanopublications)
